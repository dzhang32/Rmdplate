# Something useful!

## Package references

The below code automatically generates the `packages.bib`, a `bibtex` format for all the packages listed. If you contribute to this book and include a particular R package in your guide (as with `bookdown` above), consider adding it to the code chunk and citing it via including `[@R-package_name]` in the text.

```{r r_package_references, include = FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
